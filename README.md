# Integration of Educational Technology in University-level Statistics Course: A Comparative Study of the SRLE Model

This repository contains the instruments used in the research study on the integration of pedagogical technologies in university statistical teaching. The study was conducted with undergraduate students from the Mathematics and Computer Science degrees at the University of Sonora, in Mexico, focusing on the comparison between the current teaching method at the institution and the Statistical Reasoning Learning Environment (SRLE) model.

The web page with the activities used in the study is available at [srle-stat.io](https://srle-stat.io/) (in Spanish).

## Contents

- Pre-test and Post-test (in English, instrument): Questionnaires designed to assess students' statistical reasoning before and after the intervention.
- Structured observation log (in English, instrument): Records for detail classroom interactions, student engagement, and other relevant observations during teaching sessions.
- Student Profiling Survey (in English, instrument): A tool to gather background information about students.
- Web page code (in Spanish): The code of [srle-stat.io](https://srle-stat.io/). The web page was made using a GitHub template, so it is possible to replicate it in another repository by downloading the WebPage_with_Jekyll.zip file.
- Data recollected.
